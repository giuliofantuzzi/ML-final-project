"World Economic Forum founder, Klaus Schwab, in an address to the World Government Summit, in March 2022:   ""History is truly at a turning point. Global energy systems, food systems and supply chains will be deeply affected. In times of crisis, the role of governments is more important and more relevant than ever. The profound challenges to mankind such as climate change, are globally interconnected and require collaborative responses.""  Translation: Due to our manufactured energy crisis, contrived food shortages and deliberate sabotage of global supply chains, we must grant governments more authoritarian powers over the lives of the peasant class, while simultaneously exploiting the imaginary ""climate emergency"" to replace national sovereignty and representative democracy with one world government, ruled by unelected, unaccountable and unremovable technocrats.

"It is that time of the year on Uganda’s social calendar when there is the ba-summer (Ugandans working abroad) invasion. They are known for causing “inflation” in town because of too much spending on expensive drinks and food. Their expenditure also spreads to driving around luxurious cars.  In most cases the cars they drive have foreign registered plates because URA has issued them a Temporary Road License (TRL).  A TRL is a document usually given to foreigners intending to come into Uganda with their foreign registered vehicles or Ugandans working abroad with valid work permits. These in most cases come from South- Sudan and DRCongo. With the TRL, a person is granted a maximum of 90 days and once they elapse, they are supposed to return to their countries.  However, this is not the case. Some foreigners and the ba-summer violate the TRLs. They choose to stay and test their luck with expired TRLs which is an offense.  “If you have been granted a TRL you are not supposed to lend out your car or sell it to anyone here [Uganda] without permission. If you want to sell it, you have to notify the Commissioner Customs,” Godson Mwesigye, the Manager Enforcement operations said of the TRL violations.  With URA ’s continued vigilance, a number of culprits have been netted and had their cars impounded. The latest is a Mercedes- Benz GLE350d that was impounded in Adjumani.  According to the Customs Enforcement team in Elegu, the Benz had plates belonging to a Toyota.  “This means it had paid taxes in South-Sudan and crossed over to Uganda with un paid taxes. In order to avoid taxes, the owner was “clever” enough to change the plates belonging to a different car,"" explained a Customs officer.  The impounded Benz is currently parked at the URA offices in Elegu pending offence procedure. The penalty includes a fine of taxes amounting to USD 20,000(UGX 76,000,000).  Enforcement also revealed that the offence on violation of the TRLs starts by identifying the crime before one is penalized. Those who fail to fulfil their penalties, their cars get auctioned in the long run.  .@IBbossa, the URA Spokesperson noted that URA is expected to collect more revenue this financial year so continuous driving of non-authorized vehicles on the road affects the taxes URA collects for improved service delivery.  He also added that URA is committed to cracking the vice to ensure that every Ugandan pays their fair share of revenue.  Currently, a number of field operations are ongoing to net more culprits.
